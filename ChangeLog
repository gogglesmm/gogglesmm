  - Album list view with album covers in a grid.
  - File browser view.
  - MPRIS v2 Interface.
  - Fullscreen Presentation mode.
  - New minimalist UI.
  - Music Library Improvements:
      o Support composer and conductor tags.
      o Support tagging tracks instead of genre.
      o Ratings Support.

  - Support the XDG spec (http://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-0.6.html).
      o Config files have moved to $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/gogglesmm.
      o The database has been moved to $XDG_DATA_HOME/gogglesmm.
      o Temporary files are saved to $XDG_CACHE_HOME/gogglesmm.

0.10.2

0.10.0
  - Database Improvements:

      o Improved performance when modifying the database (importing & removing tracks)
      o Added fields for per track artist (issue 72)

  - Import Improvements:

      o Added "Sync Folder" capability, which can also update or remove tracks in the database if needed.
      o Added import exclusion filter for file and folders. (issue 84)
      o Redesigned import dialog. It now contains the import options that were previously in the preferences dialog.
      o Added a filename template input to grab track information from a filename. This replaces
        the less flexible "title from filename","album from directory" and "artist from directory".
      o Added option to choose where to read the track information from: filename, tag or both.
      o Replaced "Default Title", "Default Album", "Default Artist" and "Default Genre" with a single "Default Field"
        since most of time you would likely use the same text anyway.

      o Removed the Import File(s) option. I don't think it's needed that much, and it reduces the number of choices a user has to make.
        Importing single files can still be accomplished through drag-and-drop.

      o Send cover art through dbus to notify daemon directly instead of saving it to disk.
      o allow to write tags when editing even if tracks have not been modified.
      o more flexible input to select which fields need to be searched (issue 51).
      o allow quoted strings in search field.
      o Support for Multimedia Keys.
      o Optionally display playing track in title bar.
      o The album list may now also be sorted by album year.

  - Filename Renamer

      o The excluded character set may now be changed for the filename renamer.
      o Added year and disc parameters.
